# JUnit5-parameterized-tests

## Overview

  This repository contains my solo software testing mini-project produced within **CTU FEE B6B36TS1 - Software Testing** university course.  
  Per its requirements, JUnit 5 default and parameterized tests with data providers are covering the requested methods that are critical for
the valid behaviour of the model that is being tested. The model itself is a fairly simplified instance of an E-Shop, that has items storage,
shopping carts, orders, different representation of items from the perspective of clients' orders and storage, an archive that stores the history of the orders themselves and
the history of the overall sales per particular items, a controller that manages all the processes.  
  The project uses classic Maven structure on top of the default CTU FEE class packaging - E-Shop model classes as such are located in their packages inside **src/main/java/cz/cvut/fel/ts1**;
their corresponding testing classes - inside **src/test/java/cz/cvut/fel/ts1**.
